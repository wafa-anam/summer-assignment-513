            <h2>Mount Engadine Lodge</h2>

            <p>As a last hurrah before summer ended, Abdallah suggested a fancy trip to Mount Engadine Lodge. Greg opted out so Hanan, Molly, Abdallah, and I booked a cozy glamping tent for the 4 of us. The tent ended up being nicer than most hotels I've been in! Here is a photo of me frolicking, with the lodge and Mount Engadine in view.</p>

                        One of our main weekend plans was to eat!!! There are 4 meals included with every booking at Engadine and special accommodations are made for dietary needs. We made sure to call in advance and they were actually able to get locally sourced halal meat for one of our meals. We also planned all of our adventures around tea time which runs from 2-5pm daily as the meals were definitely a group priority. Pictured is the salad course from dinner on our first night there.

                        I developed knee issues while hiking this summer and after testing it out, determined that I am unable to hike 2 days in a row. As an alternate activity for our first day, our group decided to rent bikes from the lodge. None of us mountain bike and we had so much fun but we also sucked. Covering just 20km on relatively flat ground took us a half day. Luckily the activity was short enough for us to catch tea pretty early. The photo is of me on a mountain bike that I fell in love with! I am missing it as I type this...

                        We picked Snow Peak as our objective for the second day. The approach via Burstall Pass was incredible and I will recommend it to everyone. Even with smoke blocking out all of the distant peaks, the views of the larches and pass were stunning. I will probably try to repeat this hike in more clear conditions. Pictured is me and my siblings napping at the summit of Snow Peak. This was taken moments before we were rudely awakened by a stranger with limited boundaries.

            <p>This weekend was so fun and relaxing. It's not always possible to stay somewhere so luxurious when visiting the mountains but I'm glad I got the chance this summer. I am feeling refreshed and ready to tackle SENG513 now! Thanks to my crew of photographers for a lovely time.</p>
