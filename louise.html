            <h2>Lake Louise</h2>

            <p>As usual, it was Abdallah that suggested and planned this fabulous weekend. The full squad headed out to Lake Louise and stayed at the relatively inexpensive HI Lake Louise. Pictured below is the "Spork Squad" (from left to right- Molly, Abdallah, Hanan, Greg, Me) on the summit of Fossil Mountain.</p>

                        The first day of the trip, we drove out from Calgary butt early to try and get to the trailhead for Fossil Peak at a good time. Turns out that missing the sleep was worth it! None of us had been to the Skoki area before and all of us can agree that it's one of the most stunning places we've ever seen. The day ended up also being quite long and gruelling (especially for me) so an early start was a good idea.

            <p>Here are some shots of happy hikers. On the left is goofy Greg grinning in my Ray-bans. To the right is a couple of smiling sisters. I'll be honest, my smile did not last to the end of the hike. On the descent, my knee became aggravated and caused me pain almost to the point of tears.</p>

            <p>My knee pain was still pretty bad the morning after Fossil Mountain. Molly, Abdallah, and Hanan decided to pursue the next big hiking day without me. I was a little sad but with Greg's company, I made the most of it. The two of us went to check out the sport climbing at Louise instead. One of the biggest perks of doing this was that we didn't have to wake up at 4am with the rest of the group! There were some mishaps in getting to the crag, but we can look back and laugh at them now. I will not share them here because they are too embarrassing. Here are a couple of pictures I snapped on my iPhone from the top of a route. See if you can spot Greg belaying me in the first! And check out how lovely the colour of Lake Louise looks even in a low-quality selfie.</p>
