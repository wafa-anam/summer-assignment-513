            <h2>Frank Slide</h2>

            <p>One of my favourite places to go this summer was Frank Slide. Hanan and I had never bouldered outdoors before, and after an introduction to it by our friend Jerome, we fell in love. We ended up driving to Frank for a couple of day trips as well as two weekend camping trips.</p>

                        This was our first campsite from my most magical trip to the slide. And yes- we had more than one campsite on the same trip! After setting everything up, having dinner, and starting to wind down for the evening, we were chased away from this site by a high school graduation bonfire. The kids were friendly and invited us to join but our group decided we'd rather sleep and get some sends the next day. Packing up and moving camp in the dark was crazy stressful, but the new spot ended up being really charming in the daylight. Pictured here is Hanan hanging out by her freshly setup tent while the rest of our group sets up for dinner behind her.

                        Our new campsite ended up being right by a lovely and cool river perfect for a soak after a hot day of climbing. Walking along the river, we discovered a really deep spot where the rock slide had dumped a rock right into the center. A bunch of people from our group ended up cliff jumping from this rock. I was too nervous since my swimming abilities aren't the best, but maybe next summer!

                        Here is a picture of the adorable Emma providing shade for some of the climbers. The weather in Frank ended up being brutally hot most of the summer and it was difficult to climb for long periods of time. Having just injured her ankle, this strong climber volunteered to mainly take photos of us, and cast some shade so we could climb more comfortably.
